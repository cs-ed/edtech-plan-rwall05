# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan.

The educational technology plan is being created to address computational thinking skills. 

### Course

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level

The educational technology plan is being created to address computational thinking skills. The need is that students are excellent at looking up facts, doing research.  However their thinking skills could be better developed.  This course requires both protocols based on facts and the ability for students to think. 

Independent thinking is a skill and collaborative thinking is also a skill.  This course will require students to problem solve independently and collaborate on solutions in order to reach a consensus on the best strategy.  
 

### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

The McKinley Institute of Technology is a title 1 school located in Silicon Valley. Primarily students are of Latinx with strong bi-lingual skills and great attitudes. Influencing the plan is the fact that computational thinking does not fall under the traditional math/science/or other disciplines and therefore is not requred in elementary schools. Therefore it can be taught as an enrichment/elective class which improves the calibar of student that will participate.  Technical resources are strong, the school wifi is consistently high speed and the proxiy filter allow access to all requred resources.  


## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
